# ### Splitting training and validation
#
# Split training and validation set. Once you have the agent trained you can validate the metrics against random policy. 
#
# ### Validation
# create validation  code
#
# ### Feature creation
# First limit the number of features using PCA
# Create features to cover periodicity (you have day column so you can have modulo 7 and modulo 30) That periodicity should be part of the state.
#
# ### Environment
# It seems to be necessary to get a docker image for kaggle competition
#
